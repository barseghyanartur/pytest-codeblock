>>`pytest-codeblock`_<< is a Pytest plugin that discovers Python code
examples in your reStructuredText and Markdown documentation files and
runs them as part of your test suite. This ensures your docs stay
correct and up-to-date.


Features
========

* **reStructuredText and Markdown support**: Automatically find and
  test code blocks in reStructuredText (".rst") and Markdown (".md")
  files. The only requirement here is that your code blocks shall have
  a name starting with "test_".

* **Grouping by name**: Split a single example across multiple code
  blocks; the plugin concatenates them into one test.

* **Pytest markers support**: Add existing or custom pytest markers to
  the code blocks and add hook into the tests life-cycle using
  "conftest.py".


Prerequisites
=============

* Python 3.9+

* pytest is the only required dependency


Documentation
=============

* Documentation is available on Read the Docs.

* For reStructuredText, see a dedicated reStructuredText docs.

* For Markdown, see a dedicated Markdown docs.

* Both reStructuredText docs and Markdown docs have extensive
  documentation on pytest markers and corresponding "conftest.py"
  hooks.

* For guidelines on contributing check the Contributor guidelines.


Installation
============

Install with pip:

   pip install pytest-codeblock

Or install with >>`uv`_<<:

   uv pip install pytest-codeblock


Configuration
=============

*Filename: pyproject.toml*

   [tool.pytest.ini_options]
   testpaths = [
       "**/*.rst",
       "**/*.md",
   ]


Usage
=====


reStructruredText usage
-----------------------

Any code directive, such as ".. code-block:: python", ".. code::
python", or literal blocks with a preceding ".. codeblock-name:
<name>", will be collected and executed automatically, if your pytest
configuration allows that.


"code-block" directive example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:

  Note that ":name:" value has a "test_" prefix.

*Filename: README.rst*

   .. code-block:: python
      :name: test_basic_example

      import math

      result = math.pow(3, 2)
      assert result == 9


"literalinclude" directive example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:

  Note that ":name:" value has a "test_" prefix.

*Filename: README.rst*

   .. literalinclude:: examples/python/basic_example.py
       :name: test_li_basic_example

See a dedicated reStructuredText docs for more.


Markdown usage
--------------

Any fenced code block with a recognized Python language tag (e.g.,
"python", "py") will be collected and executed automatically, if your
pytest configuration allows that.

Note:

  Note that "name" value has a "test_" prefix.

*Filename: README.md*

   ```python name=test_basic_example
   import math

   result = math.pow(3, 2)
   assert result == 9
   ```

See a dedicated Markdown docs for more.


Tests
=====

Run the tests with pytest:

   pytest

Security Policy
===============


Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

**Do not report security issues on GitHub!**

Please report security issues by emailing Artur Barseghyan
<artur.barseghyan@gmail.com>.


Supported Versions
------------------

The two most recent "pytest-codeblock" minor release series receive
security support. It is recommended to use the latest version.

   ┌─────────────────┬────────────────┐
   │ Version         │ Supported      │
   ├─────────────────┼────────────────┤
   │ 0.1.x           │ Yes            │
   ├─────────────────┼────────────────┤
   │ < 0.1           │ No             │
   └─────────────────┴────────────────┘

Note:

  For example, during the development cycle leading to the release of
  "pytest-codeblock" 0.17.x, support will be provided for "pytest-
  codeblock" 0.16.x.Upon the release of "pytest-codeblock" 0.18.x,
  security support for "pytest-codeblock" 0.16.x will end.

Developer prerequisites
-----------------------


pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to pre-commit for installation instructions.

TL;DR:

   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Install uv
   uv tool install pre-commit  # Install pre-commit
   pre-commit install  # Install pre-commit hooks

Installing pre-commit will ensure you adhere to the project code
quality standards.


Code standards
--------------

ruff and doc8 will be automatically triggered by pre-commit.

ruff is configured to do the job of black and isort as well.

Still, if you want to run checks manually:

   make doc8
   make ruff


Requirements
------------

Requirements are compiled using >>`uv`_<<.

   make compile-requirements


Virtual environment
-------------------

You are advised to work in virtual environment.

TL;DR:

   python -m venv env
   pip install -e .[all]


Documentation
-------------

Check the documentation.


Testing
-------

Check testing.

If you introduce changes or fixes, make sure to test them locally
using all supported environments. For that use tox.

   tox

In any case, GitHub Actions will catch potential errors, but using tox
speeds things up.

For a quick test of the package and all examples, use the following
*Makefile* command:

   make test-all


Pull requests
-------------

You can contribute to the project by making a pull request.

For example:

* To fix documentation typos.

* To improve documentation (for instance, to add new recipe or fix an
  existing recipe that doesn't seem to work).

* To introduce a new feature (for instance, add support for a non-
  supported file type).

**Good to know:**

* This library is almost dependency free. Do not submit pull requests
  with external dependencies unless it's really necessary.

**General list to go through:**

* Does your change require documentation update?

* Does your change require update to tests?

* Does your change rely on third-party package or a cloud based
  service? If so, please consider turning it into a dedicated
  standalone package, since this library is dependency free (and will
  always stay so).

**When fixing bugs (in addition to the general list):**

* Make sure to add regression tests.

**When adding a new feature (in addition to the general list):**

* Make sure to update the documentation (check whether the
  installation and features require changes).


GitHub Actions
--------------

Only non-EOL versions of Python and software >>`pytest-codeblock`_<<
aims to integrate with are supported.

On GitHub Actions includes tests for more than 40 different variations
of Python versions and integration packages. Future, non-stable
versions of Python are being tested too, so that new
features/incompatibilities could be seen and adopted early.

For the list of Python versions supported by GitHub, see GitHub
Actions versions manifest.


Questions
---------

Questions can be asked on GitHub discussions.


Issues
------

For reporting a bug or filing a feature request, use GitHub issues.

**Do not report security issues on GitHub**. Check the support
section.
